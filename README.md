## Course Description

This course presents the purpose of APIs (Application Program Interface), their functions, and
how to use and manage them in the context of web development. Topics include REST
methodologies, SOAP Request / Responses, JSON WEB APIs, REST based Authentication
and Authorization, Microservices, ESBâ€™s (Enterprise Service Bus), and Testing and Debugging
APIs. Node.js is used for building RESTful APIs and SOAP UI is used for testing and
debugging them. GitHub is used to host and share coding projects. 

Prerequisite: None

## Repository Overview 

Carefully read the assigned chapters, videos, and narrative I've included under each exercise and assignment.  

Most exercises and assignments have runnable sample code so you can visually see the concept "in action."  Assignments are broken into "milestones" and each "milestone" builds on the last.  

Approach every week from top-to-bottom and do not move to the next assignment/exercise without fully understanding the previous.
